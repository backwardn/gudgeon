# Acknowledgements

I would like to, first and foremost, acknowledge that this project wouldn't be a reality without projects like DNSMasq, PiHole, and [this beautiful DNS library](https://github.com/miekg/dns). There's also the [long list](go.mod) of other modules used by Gudgeon. We all stand on the shoulders of giants and we are all very greatful for the amazing, free, software that we enjoy everyday.
