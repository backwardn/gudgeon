  # using the hash32 storage is small (only 32bits per entry) and 
  # is faster than the memory-based solution but you lose the
  # ability to see the actual matched rule. this is a good trade
  # off for embedded systems or other areas where memory is at a 
  # premium. There is also a chance for false positivies but
  # it should be fairly low... to offset that you can use "complex"
  # rules in a whitelist. (Non-complex rules would have the same
  # false positive issue.)

  # reducing the number of lists helps but since the hash storage scales
  # pretty well you can use more lists if required. the hash32 uses 32bits
